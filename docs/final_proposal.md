## 2. Background


Using data science and machine learning, predictive modeling for health inspections helps predict which restaurants might fail health inspections done by local health departments. It uses past inspection info, restaurant details, and more to find places that might have food safety issues. By doing so, it aims to assist health departments in allocating their inspection resources more effectively and improving public health by reducing foodborne illnesses.

Food safety is a critical public health concern, and restaurants play a significant role in ensuring the safety of the food they serve to the public. The usual health inspections take a lot of time and might not happen often enough to stop problems. Predictive modeling for health inspections is important for a few reasons:

  *Resource Allocation:* It helps health departments decide which places to inspect more often based on how risky they are. Risky places get checked more, and safer ones get checked less. This way, resources are used well.

  *Early Intervention:* By identifying establishments with a higher likelihood of violations, health departments can step in early to help them follow the rules and keep food safe.

  *Public Health:* Doing inspections this way can lead to a reduction in foodborne illnesses and related hospitalizations, ultimately improving public health outcomes.
  
### Research questions

- Analysis:
  
 What key factors influence the likelihood of a restaurant failing an inspection?

- ML:

How can predictive modeling be used to allocate inspection resources more efficiently? For example, can we prioritize inspections for high-risk establishments while reducing the frequency of inspections for low-risk ones?
